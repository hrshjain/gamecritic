## README

A sample Rails app for posting Game reviews

## Deployment

The application has been built using Docker Container.

## Challenges Faced

1. Environment variables within a production ready docker image. I have used them in Heroku\Jenkins.

2. Should have used Scaffold for quick Turnaround. Given more time to bootstrap, layout and design of the website.
